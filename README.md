## Installation
- Download Boost Library from the [official website](https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
- Extract the library into any directory
- Set the environment variable BOOST_ROOT to the location of Boost

For example:

```
wget "https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.75.0/source/boost_1_75_0.tar.gz" -o "/usr/home/boost_1_75_0.tar.gz"
tar -xzvf /usr/home/boost_1_75_0.tar.gz
export BOOST_ROOT="/usr/home/boost_1_75_0/"
printenv | grep BOOST_ROOT
```

Alternatively, you can add the `boost` library via various `apt` respositorys.

Then clone `dooked` and compile it, as follows:

```
git clone "https://github.com/codingo/dooked.git"
cd dooked
git submodule update --init
cd dooked/CLI11 && git checkout tags/v1.9.1
cd ../
cmake .
make
```

## Requirements
- Boost C++ library
- cmake
- any C++ compiler (supporting C++17) or MSVC(for Windows).

## Usage

For comprehensive help, use `dooked --help`

### Record history fields

JSON output includes `first-seen`, `last-seen`, and `seen` fields for each
record. When a previous JSON output is passed back into `dooked`, records that
are not present in the latest run are preserved with their last observed
timestamp so rotating responses can be tracked over time.

Useful reporting options:

```
--fs                 show records seen for the first time
--ls 2               show records not seen for at least 2 days
--lsd 05/01/2026    show records not seen since a US date
```
